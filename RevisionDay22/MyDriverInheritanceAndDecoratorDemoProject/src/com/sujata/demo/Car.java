/*
 * Abstract : is like sharing decision/contracts with child classes programmatically
 * Rule for abstract
 * 1. Abstract can be a class or method
 * 2. Abstract class cannot be instantiated( means , we can't create object but can create reference variable)
 * 3. Abstract method have only declaration , no method body not even blank method body
 * 4. If a class have even one abstract method then its mandatory to mark class also as abstract
 * 5. Child classes of abstract class must implement all the abstract method of Parents class,
 * otherwise child class also needs to mark itself as abstract and then no one will able to create object of child class as well
